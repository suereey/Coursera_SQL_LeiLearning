Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table =  10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10,000
vi. Checkin =  493
vii. Photo =  10,000
viii. Tip =   537
ix. User =  10,000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: 
	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM user
	WHERE id IS NULL
	OR name IS NULL
	OR review_count IS NULL
	OR yelping_since IS NULL
	OR useful IS NULL
	OR funny IS NULL
	OR cool IS NULL
	OR fans IS NULL
	OR average_stars IS NULL
	OR compliment_hot IS NULL
	OR compliment_more IS NULL
	OR compliment_profile IS NULL

	OR compliment_note IS NULL
	OR compliment_plain IS NULL
	OR compliment_cool IS NULL
	OR compliment_funny IS NULL
	OR compliment_writer IS NULL
	OR compliment_photos IS NULL
	
	
	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1.0	max:5.0		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes

	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000	avg: 24.995

	- Based on the result, we cannot conclude more reviews correlated with more fans. If we do a linear regression between review_count and fans, the correlation is not significant.
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: yes. There are 1780 "love" and 232 "hate".
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select count (*)
	from review
	where text like '%love%';

	select count (*)
	from review
	where text like '%hate%';


	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select name, id, fans
	from user
	order by fans desc
	LIMIT 10

	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+-----------+------------------------+------+
	| name      | id                     | fans |
	+-----------+------------------------+------+
	| Amy       | -9I98YbNQnLdAmcYfb324Q |  503 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No, there is not clear indication on the relationship between location and rating. Maybe more resturant data is needed in order to reach to this conclusion.

SQL code used for analysis:
select business.name, business.city, category.category, business.stars,hours.hours,
business.review_count,business.address,business.postal_code
FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id =category.business_id) 
INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id =business.id
WHERE business.city = 'Toronto' AND category.category = "Food" 
GROUP BY business.stars;
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
The oepned business has higher ratings
         
ii. Difference 2:
The oepned business has higher review count
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select business.name, business.is_open, category.category, business.stars, 
hours.hours, business.review_count, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Toronto' 
 group by business.is_open;
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
I want to see which states has user more active on writing reviews.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I will need the review_count and the state data from the business. 
I will order the data in descendent regarding to the review_count.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
The NV states has the highest review_count.

 +-------+--------------+
| state | review_count |
+-------+--------------+
| NV    |         3873 |
| QC    |         1757 |

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

select state, review_count
from business
order by review_count desc;
